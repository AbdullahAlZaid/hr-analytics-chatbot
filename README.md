\# HR Analytics Chatbot



An AI-powered \*\*chat-based HR analytics dashboard\*\* that allows users to ask natural language questions about HR data and receive accurate, data-backed answers.



This project uses a \*\*Text-to-SQL approach\*\*, supports \*\*dual AI models (local and cloud)\*\*, and maintains \*\*chat memory\*\* for follow-up questions. The dashboard is built using \*\*Streamlit\*\* and styled to match \*\*Solutions by stc\*\* branding.

\## 🔹 Features



\- 💬 Chat-based interface for HR analytics

\- 🧠 Natural language → SQL conversion (Text-to-SQL)

\- ⚡ Dual-model architecture:

&nbsp; - \*\*Local model (1.5B)\*\* for fast responses

&nbsp; - \*\*Cloud model (7B via Groq API)\*\* for higher accuracy

\- 🔁 Automatic fallback to cloud model when needed

\- 🧾 SQL-backed answers using structured HR data

\- 📊 Tabular results displayed when applicable

\- 🧠 Chat memory for follow-up questions

\- 🎨 Branded dashboard UI (Solutions by stc identity)

\## 🔹 How the Chatbot Works



1\. The user asks a question in plain English  

2\. The AI model converts the question into a SQL query  

3\. The SQL query is executed on the HR dataset using DuckDB  

4\. Results are returned as a natural language explanation and a table (when applicable)  

5\. Conversation history is stored in session state to support follow-up questions

\## 🔹 Dual-Model Approach



The chatbot uses two AI models:



\### Local Model (1.5B)

\- Runs locally

\- Faster response time

\- Used by default



\### Cloud Model (7B)

\- Accessed via Groq API

\- Higher accuracy

\- Automatically used when:

&nbsp; - The local model fails

&nbsp; - SQL is invalid

&nbsp; - The result is unreliable



This approach balances \*\*performance and accuracy\*\*.

\## 🔹 Why Text-to-SQL (Not RAG)?



\- The HR dataset is \*\*structured (CSV / tabular data)\*\*

\- Text-to-SQL ensures:

&nbsp; - Accurate counts and percentages

&nbsp; - No hallucinated values

&nbsp; - Transparent and explainable queries



RAG is more suitable for \*\*unstructured data\*\* such as documents, policies, or PDFs, which are outside the scope of this project.

\## 🔹 Chat Memory



The chatbot maintains \*\*session-level memory\*\*, allowing users to ask follow-up questions such as:



\- “What about only the Sales department?”

\- “Now compare it with Research \& Development”



This is implemented using \*\*Streamlit session state\*\*.
